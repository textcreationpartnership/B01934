            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE, or preſent State Of the Refiners of SUGARS in <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Ancient Trade of Refineing Sugars has (by reaſon of its great Increaſe for Forty or Fifty Years paſt) occaſioned the expending of vaſt Summs of Money in Erecting, and Fitting up in ſeveral parts of this Kingdom, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny large and convenient Works for the Manageing, and Carrying on of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Growth and Increaſe of this Trade, did (for many Years paſt) run parrallel with the Succeſs of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, and through the Indulgence and Favour of the Government had not only beaten out the <hi>Lisbone</hi> Trade, from whence this Nation was formerly ſerved with White Sugars; But had Extended it ſelf to the ſupplying of moſt Forreign Parts, and particularly the greateſt part of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Country, which was a very beneficial Trade to this Kingdom, becauſe the Returns were uſually made in thoſe profitable Commodities of Pitch, Tarr and Hemp.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom (being Maſter of the moſt Conſiderable and Profitable Sugar Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the whole World) ſtands upon the greateſt advantage to Improve and Inrich it ſelf, by Incourageing the Manufacturing of our own Plantation Broun-Sugars within its ſelf, and thereby inable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants (in the way of their Traſick) to ſupply Forreign Markets with our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refined Sugars. And certainly, had God and Nature put ſo great an Advantage into the Hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> (their Prudence in Trade, leads us to conclude) they would not have Trifled with it, but by an effectual Incouragement of the Refineing of their Plantation Broun-Sugars within themſelves, they would have ſecur'd the ſupplying of all Forreign Markets to themſelves, and given Laws to the World as to that Commodity; which ſtill remains in the power of <hi>England</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>Our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> have for ſome Years paſt, moſt Studiouſly (and that with great Succeſs) Incouraged this expenſive and beneficial Trade within themſelves, having been greatly Inabled thereunto, by an Act made in the Firſt Year of the late King <hi>James,</hi> allowing the Exporter of our Plantation Broun-Sugar to draw back, not only the 9 <hi>d. per</hi> hundred which is the half Impoſt, but alſo the whole Additional Duty of 2 <hi>s.</hi> and 4 <hi>d.</hi> which in the whole makes 3 <hi>s.</hi> and 1 <hi>d.</hi> draw back, upon every Hundred Weight of our Exported Broun-Sugars; By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof our Neighbours have afforded, thoſe very Refined Sugars, which they have made from our own Plantation Broun-Sugars, near 20 <hi>l. per Cent</hi> cheaper then we could, even at thoſe very Forreign Markets, which were formerly ſerved from this Kingdom; whereby this Trade has been greatly Diſcouraged here at home, and the ſupply of all Forreign Markets put intirely into the hands of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by reaſon of another Act made in the laſt Seſſions of this preſent Parliament, for Incouraging the Conſumption of Corn, ſo high a duty is laid, not only on the low Wines drawn from Plantation Moloſſes (which pays but the ſmall and unproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duty of 8 <hi>d. per</hi> hundred inwards) but alſo, on the low Wines drawn from our own home made Moloſſes, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refiners are quite cut off from the Vend of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſes here at home, and are now wholly diſabled from carrying on their Trades.</p>
            <p>And if this Trade be not timely Releived by the Wiſdom of Parliament, it muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be Totally loſt in this Kingdom, and conſequently given up to our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The Releif that is Humbly Deſired, for the preſervation of this Ancient Trade in this Kingdom, Is, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refiners may have (at leaſt) as much Incouragement to Work our own Plantation Broun-Sugars here at home, as Forreigners now have to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them and Work them abroad, by giving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refiners ſuch a draw back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Exportation of their Refined Sugar and Moloſſes, as ſhall bare a proportion to the draw back of 3 <hi>s.</hi> and 1 <hi>d.</hi> which the Exporter now has upon the Exportation of our Plantation Broun-Sugars.</p>
            <p>This Releif and Incouragement being given to this Trade, the Conſequences thereof will moſt certainly prove, the great Increaſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation, which (under God) is the Strength, Wealth and Glory of this Kingdom, The Imployment and Livelyhood of many Thouſands of Their Majeſties Subjects here at home, And a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Increaſe of the Wealth, and Treaſure of this Kingdom.</p>
